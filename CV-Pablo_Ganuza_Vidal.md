Technical skills
----------------

Programming Languages
:	_Please, check out my [gitlab](https://gitlab.com/pabgan) and [github (deprecated)](https://github.com/pabgan) profiles for some of my code._
:	**Python:** (~3y) Still a junior, but comfortable enough to write tests, scripts and small to medium applications. I am **very interested** in pushing this forward and even becoming a legit Python developer.

:	**SQL:** (~4y) I have used it daily to extract information from DB and review views' definitions.

:	**ZSH/Bash:** (~4y) I do some _not-that-basic-anymore_ scripting to ease my life.

:	**Java:** (~6y) I started as a Java intern developer. I am comfortable writing any kind of application, but still not a developer.


Other technologies
:	**Linux:** I have used it as my main and unique (when possible) system since 2007. I prefer doing things on the terminal than through GUIs. ZSH, tmux and neoVIM are always running in my system.
   
:	**Git:** Comfortable with common use cases (push, pull, commit, branch, discard changes, etc.). Basic knowledge of other VCSs such as **Subversion** and **CVS**.

:	**Jenkins:** I know my way around it. I have never been in charge of it though.


On the hunt for
:	Python, containers, Ansible and automation and DevOps in general.
:	UNIX philosophy at work.
:	Remote working.
