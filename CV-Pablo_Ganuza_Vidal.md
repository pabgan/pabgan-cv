Technical skills
----------------

Programming Languages
:	**Python:** ~2 years of experience (not every day, as it is not my main responsibility). Still a junior, but comfortable enough to write tests, scripts and small to medium applications.
	I am *very interested* in pushing this forward and even becoming a legit Python developer.

:	**SQL:** ~3 years of experience. I have used it daily to gather information from DB and review views' definitions.

:	**ZSH/Bash:** ~3 years of experience (not every day, as it is not my main responsibility). I do some not so basic anymore scripting to ease my life.

:	**Java:** I started as a Java intern developer. I am comfortable writing any kind of application, but still not a developer. I have written some functional **Android** applications for internal and personal consumption.

:	_Please, check out my [github](https://github.com/pabgan) and [gitlab](https://gitlab.com/pabgan) profiles for some of my code._

Other technologies
:	**Linux:** I have used it as my main and unique (when possible) system since 2007. I prefer doing things on the terminal than through GUIs. ZSH, tmux and VIM are always running in my system.
   
:	**Git:** Comfortable with common use cases (push, pull, commit, branch, discard changes, etc.). Basic knowledge of other VCSs such as **Subversion** and **CVS**.

:	**Jenkins:** I know my way around it. I have never been in charge of it though.

QA specific software
:	Selenium, Robotium, SoapUI, Jira, Trac, Testlink, Microsoft Test Manager
